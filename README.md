## About

This node API connects to a minecraft server hosted strictly on a [AWS EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/ec2/) using the [AWS node SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/EC2.html) and [this minecraft protocol package](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol).

If you are interested in running your own minecraft AWS server instance to comunicate with this API, please, contact the owner of this repository.
